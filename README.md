Online version of the board game "Imaginarium".

A registered player can create a game and invite their friends using an invite link or a QR code.

At the beginning of the game, players are given pictures (which other players do not see).
The role of the presenter passes from player to player "clockwise".
The presenter chooses one of his cards and names his association with this card. The association can be anything: a word, a sentence, a poem, a famous quote.

1. If all the players guessed the presenter's card, then the presenter does not receive any points, and the other players receive 3 points each.
2. If no one guessed the presenter's card, then he also receives nothing, and all the other players receive 1 point each.
3. In any other case, the presenter and the players who correctly guessed his picture receive 3 points each.

The game continues until the pictures run out. The winner is the one who receives the most points for the game.
